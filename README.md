# MosaicMovements
Mosaic art takes on a process where a large variety of different, broken pieces of glass are gathered and placed together to form a beautiful mas- terpiece. That is the heartbeat of Mosaic Investment Group. Where a large variety of different, broken human-beings gather and come together to form a beautiful master piece. Through investing in different businesses &amp; projects, small and large, what once was impossible can now be achieved through mosaic investments and projects. We are a small team of entrepreneurs, leaders, and consultants focused on bringing change to areas with the greatest needs. Our aim is to bring economic impact, healthcare upgrades, educational improvements, and leadership development through very intentional projects and businesses.
